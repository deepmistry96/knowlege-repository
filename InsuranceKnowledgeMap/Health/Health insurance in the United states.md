The structure of [[health insurance]] in the United States is complex, involving multiple types of coverage and providers. Here’s an overview of the general structure:

### 1. Types of Health Insurance

- **[[Employer-Sponsored Insurance (ESI)]]**: The most common type of health insurance, where coverage is provided through one’s employer. Employers often pay a portion of the premiums, and coverage may extend to family members.
- **[[Individual Market Plans]]**: Insurance purchased directly by individuals from private companies. This market has expanded significantly with the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
- **[[Medicare]]**: A federal program providing health coverage if you are 65 or older or have a severe disability, no matter your income.
- **[[Medicaid]]**: A state and federal program providing health coverage for some low-income people, families and children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people with disabilities.
- **Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)**: Provides coverage for children in families with incomes too high to qualify for Medicaid but too low to afford private coverage.

### 2. Health Insurance Providers

- **[[Private Insurance Companies]]**: These are commercial insurers that offer a wide range of health insurance products in the employer-sponsored and individual markets.
- **[[Non-Profit Health Plans]]**: These plans are offered by non-profit organizations and may be available through employers or in the individual market.
- **[[Government-Sponsored Programs]]**: Includes Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP.

### 3. Health Insurance Plans

- **[[Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs)]]**: Require members to obtain health care services from an in-network provider. Typically emphasizes preventive care.
- **[[Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs)]]**: Provide more flexibility when selecting a doctor or hospital. They also offer out-of-network service coverage, but at a higher out-of-pocket cost.
- **[[Exclusive Provider Organizations (EPOs)]]**: A managed care plan where services are covered only if you use doctors, specialists, or hospitals in the plan’s network (except in an emergency).
- **[[Point of Service (POS)]]**: Combines elements of both HMOs and PPOs. Typically, you need a [[primary care doctor]] and need referrals to see [[specialists]], but you may also use [[Out-of-network]] [[providers]] at a higher cost.

### 4. Financing and Payment Models

- **Premiums**: Regular payments made to the insurance company to keep the policy active.
- **Deductibles**: The amount you pay out of pocket each year before your health insurance begins to pay its share.
- **Copayments and Coinsurance**: Payments made each time a medical service is rendered. Copayments are usually a fixed amount (e.g., $20 per visit), whereas coinsurance is a percentage of the cost of the service.
- **Out-of-Pocket Maximums**: The most you have to spend for covered services in a year. After you spend this amount on deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance, your health plan pays 100% of the costs of covered benefits.

### 5. Regulatory Framework

- **[[The Affordable Care Act (ACA)]]**: Enacted to expand access to insurance, increase consumer protections, emphasize prevention and wellness, improve quality and system performance, expand the health workforce, and curb rising health care costs.
- **[[State Insurance Departments]]**: Each state has an insurance department that regulates health insurance policies within their state and ensures compliance with both state and federal regulations.

This structure creates a diverse landscape of health insurance options, designed to meet the varying needs of the American population.
