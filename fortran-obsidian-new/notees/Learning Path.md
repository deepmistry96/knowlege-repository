To start learning Fortran effectively, consider these steps:

- **Set Up Your Environment**: Install a Fortran compiler (like GNU Fortran or Intel Fortran) on your machine.
- **Get a Good Textbook or Online Course**: Textbooks like "Fortran 95/2003 for Scientists and Engineers" can be helpful. Online platforms like Coursera or edX may also offer courses.
- **Practice Coding**: Write small programs that solve basic problems to get familiar with the syntax.
- **Explore Numerical Libraries**: Get a sense of how libraries like LAPACK or BLAS work with Fortran for complex computations.
