### Key Information about The Golden Apple of Discord

#### Origins and Characters
1. **The Wedding of Peleus and Thetis**:
   - The story begins with the wedding of Peleus, a mortal hero, and Thetis, a sea nymph. All the gods and goddesses were invited to the celebration, except for Eris, the goddess of discord and strife.

2. **Eris (Discord)**:
   - Eris, angered by her exclusion from the wedding, sought revenge by creating chaos. She devised a plan to incite jealousy and competition among the goddesses.

3. **The Golden Apple**:
   - Eris crafted a golden apple inscribed with the words "To the fairest" (in Greek, "τῇ καλλίστῃ"). She threw the apple into the midst of the wedding guests, knowing it would cause a dispute.

4. **The Contenders**:
