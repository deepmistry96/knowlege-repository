Athena is one of the most revered deities in Greek mythology, known as the goddess of wisdom, warfare, and crafts. She is the daughter of [[Zeus]] and was born in a unique manner—she sprang fully grown and armored from Zeus's forehead after he experienced an immense headache. Athena is a virgin goddess and is often referred to as "Pallas Athena." She is celebrated for her logic, intelligence, and compassion, and is considered a protector of cities, particularly the city of Athens, which is named in her honor.

### Key Attributes and Symbolism
- **Wisdom and Warfare:** Athena is unique among Greek deities for her combination of roles. She represents both intellectual and battle strategy, embodying a balance between intelligence and military prowess. She is often portrayed as a tactician rather than a brute force warrior, favoring the defense of cities and justice in warfare.
- **Crafts and Weaving:** Athena is also the patroness of various crafts, especially weaving. Myths like that of Arachne, a mortal woman who challenged Athena to a weaving contest and was subsequently turned into a spider, highlight her supremacy in this skill.
- **Symbols:** Her symbols include the owl (representing wisdom) and the olive tree (representing peace and prosperity). She is frequently depicted with a helmet, shield, and a spear.

### Major Myths Involving Athena
- **Birth:** As mentioned, Athena was born from Zeus's head fully grown and clad in armor, after Hephaestus split Zeus’s head open with an axe at his request, due to the unbearable headache caused by Athena.
- **Contest with [[Poseidon]]:** Athena became the patron goddess of Athens through a contest with Poseidon. They each presented a gift to the city, and while Poseidon created a spring by striking the ground with his trident, Athena planted the first olive tree. The Athenians deemed Athena’s gift more valuable, choosing her as their patron.
- **Role in the [[Trojan War]]:** Athena was a key player in the Trojan War, where she supported the Greek heroes, especially Odysseus and Achilles. She was instrumental in various key events, including the strategy of the Trojan Horse.
- **[[Medusa]]:** Athena played a role in the tale of Medusa, one of the three Gorgons. According to one version, Medusa was once a beautiful maiden who was transformed into a monster by Athena as punishment for desecrating her temple.

### Worship and Cult
Athena was worshipped throughout Greece, but she was especially revered in Athens, where the [[Parthenon]], a temple on the Acropolis, was dedicated to her. The [[Panathenaic Festival]], the largest festival in [[Athens]], was celebrated in her honor, featuring a procession to the Acropolis, athletic and musical competitions, and sacrifices.

### Cultural Impact
Athena's influence extends beyond mythology into the realms of literature and philosophy, symbolizing rationality and a strategic approach to both war and peace. She represents an ideal of balanced leadership and is often used as a figure of inspiration for wisdom and courage. Athena’s enduring legacy can be seen in art, literature, and the continuing study of Greek mythology, where she stands as a symbol of intelligence, justice, and skill.
