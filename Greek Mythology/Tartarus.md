In Greek mythology, Tartarus is both a deity and a place in the underworld, often depicted as a deep, dark pit or abyss used as a dungeon of torment and suffering. It is located beneath even Hades, making it as far below the Earth as the heavens are above it. Tartarus plays a critical role as a prison for both the Titans and other entities who are punished by the gods.

### Tartarus as a Deity
In ancient Greek cosmogony, Tartarus is one of the primordial deities born from Chaos, along with Gaia (Earth), Eros (Love), and Erebus (Darkness). As a deity, Tartarus is the personification of the deepest, darkest pit of the underworld.

### Tartarus as a Place
As a location, Tartarus is described as a dark, dismal place at the edge of the world, surrounded by a bronze wall with a gate made of iron. It is as far from the Earth as Earth is from the sky. This makes it a place where the gods imprison their foes and is akin to a hellish realm where eternal punishments are meted out:

- **Prison for Titans**: After the defeat in the Titanomachy, many of the Titans were imprisoned in Tartarus, where they were kept under guard by the Hecatoncheires, creatures with a hundred hands who acted as sentinels.
- **Punishment of Sinners**: Mythological figures who incurred the wrath of the gods are also said to be punished in Tartarus. For example, Sisyphus is condemned to roll a huge boulder endlessly up a hill, only for it to roll down each time it nears the top, while Tantalus is plagued by eternal hunger and thirst, standing in water he cannot drink and beneath fruit he cannot eat.
- **Home of Monsters and Horrors**: Tartarus is also said to be home to various monsters and horrendous creatures like the monster Typhon and other giants.

### Cultural Significance
In Hesiod's "Theogony," Tartarus is described both as a primordial force and a place deeper than the underworld, setting it apart from Hades, which is more commonly known as the domain where the dead reside. Tartarus thus symbolizes the ultimate punishment and is a place of torment and suffering for those who defy the gods.

In later Christian writings and interpretations, Tartarus was sometimes used to describe Hell, emphasizing its aspect as a place of punishment. It holds a significant place in Greek mythology, representing the severest form of chastisement for both divine beings and mortals.
