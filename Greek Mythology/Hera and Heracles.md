The relationship between Hera and Heracles (known as Hercules in Roman mythology) is one of the most complex and antagonistic in Greek mythology. Hera, the queen of the gods, harbored a deep-seated enmity toward Heracles, who was the son of her husband, Zeus, and a mortal woman named Alcmene. Here’s an in-depth look at their relationship:

### Key Aspects of Hera and Heracles’ Relationship

#### Origins of Hera’s Hatred
1. **Infidelity of Zeus**:
   - Heracles was born from an extramarital affair between Zeus and Alcmene. Hera's jealousy and anger toward Zeus’s numerous affairs often extended to his illegitimate offspring.

2. **Birth of Heracles**:
   - Hera attempted to prevent Heracles' birth by delaying Alcmene's labor. She used her daughter, Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth, to prolong the labor and thus delay Heracles' birth, hoping to deny him his destined heroic status.

#### Infancy and Early Attempts on His Life
1. **Snakes in the Cradle**:
   - When Heracles was still an infant, Hera sent two serpents to kill him in his crib. However, the young Heracles displayed his immense strength by strangling the snakes, demonstrating his divine heritage and strength.

#### The Twelve Labors of Heracles
1. **Hera’s Role**:
   - Hera played a significant role in the Twelve Labors of Heracles, which were imposed on him as a penance. Although the tasks were assigned by King Eurystheus, Hera influenced and manipulated events to make each labor as difficult as possible.

2. **Specific Labors**:
   - **Nemean Lion**: Hera raised the Nemean Lion, which Heracles was tasked to kill.
   - **Lernaean Hydra**: Hera sent a giant crab to distract Heracles while he fought the Hydra.
   - **Hind of Ceryneia**: The hind was sacred to Hera, and Heracles had to capture it without harming it.
   - **Other Labors**: Throughout the labors, Hera continually sought to complicate Heracles' tasks and ensure his failure.

#### Later Life and Ongoing Enmity
1. **Hera’s Continued Antagonism**:
   - Even after completing the Twelve Labors, Hera continued to plague Heracles. She drove him to madness, causing him to kill his own family, which led to further penance and quests.

2. **Heracles’ Death**:
   - Hera's enmity persisted throughout Heracles’ life. His eventual death was caused indirectly by Hera’s longstanding influence. Deianira, Heracles' wife, was tricked into giving him a poisoned tunic that caused his excruciating death. The tunic was soaked in the blood of the centaur Nessus, whom Heracles had killed and who had been manipulated by Hera.

#### Apotheosis and Reconciliation
1. **Heracles’ Immortality**:
   - After Heracles’ mortal death, Zeus intervened and brought him to Mount Olympus, granting him immortality. This act essentially made him a god.

2. **Reconciliation with Hera**:
   - Despite their antagonistic relationship, Heracles and Hera reconciled after his apotheosis. As a divine being, Heracles married Hebe, the daughter of Hera and Zeus, symbolizing a final peace between them.

### Themes and Symbolism

1. **Divine Retribution**:
   - Hera’s relentless persecution of Heracles symbolizes the consequences of Zeus’s infidelity and the divine retribution meted out by a wronged goddess.

2. **Heroic Endurance**:
