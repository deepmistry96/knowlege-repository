The Olympians are a group of gods and goddesses in Greek mythology who are considered to be the major deities ruling over the cosmos. They are called Olympians because they were believed to reside on Mount Olympus, the highest mountain in Greece and the mythological home of these gods. The Olympians overthrew the earlier generation of gods, the Titans, in the Titanomachy, establishing a new order under the leadership of Zeus.

Here are the main members of the Olympians, each associated with different aspects of life and the natural world:

1. **[[Zeus]]** - The king of the gods, ruler of Mount Olympus, and god of the sky and thunder.
2. **[[Hera]]** - The queen of the gods, wife of Zeus, and goddess of marriage and family.
3. **[[Poseidon]]** - Brother of Zeus, god of the sea, earthquakes, and horses.
4. **[[Demeter]]** - Sister of Zeus, goddess of agriculture and the harvest.
5. **[[Athena]]** - Daughter of Zeus, born from his head fully armed, goddess of wisdom, war strategy, and crafts.
6. **[[Apollo]]** - Son of Zeus and Leto, twin brother of Artemis, god of the sun, prophecy, music, and healing.
7. **[[Artemis]]** - Daughter of Zeus and Leto, twin sister of Apollo, goddess of the hunt, wilderness, and childbirth.
8. **[[Ares]]** - Son of Zeus and Hera, god of war.
9. **[[Aphrodite]]** - Goddess of love and beauty, born from the sea foam, some myths claim she is the daughter of Zeus, others say she arose independently.
10. **[[Hephaestus]]** - Son of Hera, some myths claim Zeus as his father, god of fire, metalworking, and craftsmanship.
11. **[[Hermes]]** - Son of Zeus and the nymph Maia, god of trade, thieves, travelers, and messenger of the gods.
12. **[[Hestia]]** - Sister of Zeus, goddess of the hearth and domesticity. She gave up her throne for Dionysus, preferring to keep the hearth of Olympus.

### Additional Olympians:
While the above are the primary gods, a couple of others are also often included among the Olympians in some lists:

1. **[[Dionysus]]** - God of wine, festivities, and ecstatic celebrations. He is sometimes considered one of the twelve Olympians, replacing Hestia.
2. **[[Hades]]** - Brother of Zeus and ruler of the underworld, is not typically included among the Olympians as he resides in the underworld rather than on Olympus.

These gods and goddesses formed the core of numerous myths and religious beliefs in ancient Greece, playing crucial roles in narratives that explained natural phenomena, human qualities, and life events. Each deity had distinct personality traits and domains, making the mythology rich with stories and lessons.
