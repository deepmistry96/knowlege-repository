Underinsured Motorist (UIM) coverage is a type of auto insurance designed to protect you if you're involved in an accident with a driver who has insurance, but whose coverage limits are not enough to cover your damages. Here are some key points to understand about UIM coverage:

### What is Underinsured Motorist Coverage?

**Definition:** UIM coverage provides financial protection when the at-fault driver’s insurance limits are insufficient to cover your medical expenses, lost wages, and other damages resulting from the accident.

### How Does Underinsured Motorist Coverage Work?

1. **Accident Occurs:** You’re involved in an accident where the other driver is at fault.
2. **Claim Against At-Fault Driver:** You file a claim against the at-fault driver’s insurance.
3. **Insufficient Coverage:** If the at-fault driver’s insurance coverage is not enough to pay for all your damages, your UIM coverage kicks in.
4. **Claim Under Your Policy:** You then file a claim with your own insurance company under your UIM coverage to cover the remaining costs.

### What Does Underinsured Motorist Coverage Typically Include?

- **Medical Expenses:** Covers medical bills for injuries sustained in the accident.
- **Lost Wages:** Compensates for lost income if you are unable to work due to your injuries.
- **Pain and Suffering:** Provides compensation for physical and emotional pain resulting from the accident.
- **Other Damages:** May include coverage for rehabilitation, funeral expenses, and other related costs.

### Why is Underinsured Motorist Coverage Important?

1. **Gaps in Coverage:** Many drivers carry only the minimum required liability insurance, which may not be sufficient to cover serious accidents.
2. **Financial Protection:** Ensures you are not left with significant out-of-pocket expenses if the at-fault driver’s insurance is inadequate.
3. **Peace of Mind:** Provides assurance that you have additional protection beyond what the at-fault driver’s policy can offer.

### Differences Between Underinsured and Uninsured Motorist Coverage

- **Uninsured Motorist (UM) Coverage:** Protects you if you are in an accident with a driver who has no insurance at all.
- **Underinsured Motorist (UIM) Coverage:** Kicks in when the at-fault driver has insurance, but their coverage limits are not enough to cover your damages.

### Considerations When Choosing UIM Coverage

1. **Coverage Limits:** Choose limits that are appropriate for your needs. Higher limits offer more protection but come with higher premiums.
2. **State Requirements:** Some states require UIM coverage, while others make it optional. Check your state’s requirements.
3. **Stacking:** In some states, you can "stack" UIM coverage if you have multiple vehicles insured under the same policy, increasing your available coverage.

### Tips for Purchasing Underinsured Motorist Coverage

- **Evaluate Risks:** Consider the likelihood of encountering underinsured drivers in your area.
- **Assess Financial Impact:** Think about your financial situation and how much coverage you would need to feel adequately protected.
- **Compare Policies:** Get quotes from multiple insurers and compare the coverage options and costs.
- **Consult an Agent:** Speak with an insurance agent or broker to understand the best options for your specific needs.

Underinsured Motorist Coverage is a valuable addition to your auto insurance policy, providing an extra layer of protection in the event of an accident with an underinsured driver. By understanding its importance and how it works, you can make an informed decision to ensure your financial security on the road.
