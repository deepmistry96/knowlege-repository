## **MIOpen Auto-Tuning**

Auto-tuning is one of MIOpen's standout features, ensuring the optimal kernel selection for a given hardware configuration and operation. During auto-tuning:

- MIOpen benchmarks different kernel implementations for a specific convolution or other layer configurations.
- The optimal kernel based on speed and efficiency is automatically chosen and cached for future executions.
- Users can enable or disable auto-tuning as needed, and MIOpen can save tuning results to improve the speed of subsequent runs.

Auto-tuning is particularly helpful when the hardware environment is stable (e.g., the same GPU architecture), as it avoids redundant tuning processes once optimal kernels have been selected.
