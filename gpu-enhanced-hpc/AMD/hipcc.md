## **What is `hipcc`?**

### **Overview**

- **`hipcc`** is the compiler driver for **HIP**, AMD's GPU programming environment.
- It is part of the **ROCm (Radeon Open Compute)** ecosystem.
- **Purpose:** Allows developers to write GPU-accelerated code that is portable between AMD and NVIDIA GPUs.

### **Key Features**

- **Portability:** Enables a single codebase to run on both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs.
- **Compiler Wrapper:** Acts as a wrapper around underlying compilers (Clang for AMD GPUs and [[nvcc]] for NVIDIA GPUs).
- **Syntax Similarity:** HIP code closely resembles CUDA code, simplifying the porting process.

### **How `hipcc` Works**

- **For AMD GPUs:**
    - Uses **HIP-Clang**, based on the Clang/LLVM compiler.
    - Compiles code into AMD GPU machine code.
- **For NVIDIA GPUs:**
    - Translates HIP code to CUDA and uses **[[nvcc]]** to compile.
    - Provides a pathway for developers to write code that can run on both platforms.














# Detailed Comparison of **`hipcc`** and **`[[nvcc]]`**

## **Introduction**

When developing GPU-accelerated applications, choosing the right compiler is crucial. **`[[nvcc]]`** is NVIDIA's CUDA compiler driver, while **`hipcc`** is AMD's compiler driver for the HIP (Heterogeneous-computing Interface for Portability) platform. Both are designed to compile code that runs on GPUs but target different platforms and have distinct features.

This guide provides an in-depth look at **`hipcc`**, how it differs from **`[[nvcc]]`**, and what these differences mean for developers.

### **Overview**

- **`[[nvcc]]`** is NVIDIA's CUDA compiler driver.
- **Purpose:** Compiles CUDA code into executable binaries for NVIDIA GPUs.
- **Functionality:** Separates device (GPU) and host (CPU) code, compiling each appropriately.

### **Key Features**

- **CUDA Programming Model:** Supports NVIDIA's proprietary parallel computing platform.
- **Optimization:** Provides optimizations specific to NVIDIA GPU architectures.
- **Integration:** Works seamlessly with NVIDIA's tools and libraries.

## **Differences Between `hipcc` and `[[nvcc]]`**

### **1. Target Platforms**

- **`hipcc`:**
  - Targets both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs.
  - Provides portability across different hardware vendors.
- **`[[nvcc]]`:**
  - Targets only NVIDIA GPUs.
  - Optimized exclusively for NVIDIA hardware.

### **2. Underlying Compilers**

- **`hipcc`:**
  - For AMD GPUs: Uses **HIP-Clang** (Clang/LLVM-based).
  - For NVIDIA GPUs: Translates HIP code to CUDA and invokes **[[nvcc]]**.
- **`[[nvcc]]`:**
  - Uses NVIDIA's proprietary compiler for device code.
  - Relies on a host compiler (like GCC or MSVC) for CPU code.

### **3. Programming Models**

- **`hipcc`:**
  - Utilizes the **HIP API**, which is similar to CUDA but designed for portability.
  - HIP code can be compiled for both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs.
- **`[[nvcc]]`:**
  - Uses the **CUDA API**, specific to NVIDIA GPUs.
  - CUDA code is not inherently portable to other platforms.

### **4. Language Features and Extensions**

- **`hipcc`:**
  - Supports modern C++ standards (C++14, C++17) through Clang.
  - May have better support for advanced language features.
- **`[[nvcc]]`:**
  - Historically lagged in supporting the latest C++ standards.
  - Recent versions have improved C++ feature support.

### **5. Compilation Workflow**

- **`hipcc`:**
  - Acts as a wrapper, orchestrating the compilation process.
  - Uses Clang's capabilities to compile both host and device code.
- **`[[nvcc]]`:**
  - Separates host and device code.
  - Uses NVIDIA's compiler for device code and a host compiler for CPU code.

### **6. Command-Line Options**

- **`hipcc`:**
  - Accepts options for both AMD and NVIDIA targets.
  - Example: `--amdgpu-target` for specifying AMD GPU architecture.
- **`[[nvcc]]`:**
  - Provides options specific to NVIDIA architectures.
  - Example: `-arch=sm_75` to target a specific NVIDIA GPU.

### **7. Integration with Development Tools**

- **`hipcc`:**
  - Part of the ROCm platform with tools like `rocprof`, `rocm-gdb`.
  - Uses HIP-specific debugging and profiling tools.
- **`[[nvcc]]`:**
  - Integrated with NVIDIA's suite of tools like Nsight Compute and Nsight Systems.
  - Provides comprehensive debugging and profiling capabilities.

## **Detailed Look at `hipcc`**

### **Compiling HIP Code**

- **Basic Command:**

  ```bash
  hipcc -o my_program my_program.cpp
  ```

- **Specifying Target Architecture:**

  - For AMD GPUs:

    ```bash
    hipcc --amdgpu-target=gfx906 -o my_program my_program.cpp
    ```

  - For NVIDIA GPUs:

    ```bash
    hipcc --cuda-gpu-arch=sm_70 -o my_program my_program.cpp
    ```

### **Environment Variables**

- **`HIP_PLATFORM`:**

  - Determines the default target platform (`amd` or `nvidia`).
  - Example:

    ```bash
    export HIP_PLATFORM=amd
    hipcc my_program.cpp -o my_program
    ```

### **Code Portability**

- **HIP API:** Designed to be similar to CUDA, making code porting straightforward.
- **hipify Tools:** Convert CUDA code to HIP code.

### **Example HIP Code**

```cpp
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

__global__ void vector_add(const float* A, const float* B, float* C, int N) {
    int i = hipBlockIdx_x * hipBlockDim_x + hipThreadIdx_x;
    if (i < N) {
        C[i] = A[i] + B[i];
    }
}

int main() {
    // Allocate and initialize host and device memory
    // Launch kernel using hipLaunchKernelGGL
    // ...
}
```
