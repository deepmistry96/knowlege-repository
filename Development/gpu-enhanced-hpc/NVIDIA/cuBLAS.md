## **What is cu[[BLAS]]?**

**cu[[BLAS]]** is NVIDIA's GPU-accelerated version of the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (**[[BLAS]]**) library. It provides highly optimized implementations of standard linear algebra operations, such as vector and matrix computations, specifically designed to run efficiently on NVIDIA GPUs using the CUDA programming model.

### **Key Features of [[cuBLAS]]**

1. **High Performance:**
    
    - Leverages the massive parallelism of NVIDIA GPUs.
    - Offers significant speedups over CPU-based [[BLAS]] libraries.
2. **[[BLAS]] Level Support:**
    
    - **Level 1 [[BLAS]]:** Vector-vector operations (e.g., dot product).
    - **Level 2 [[BLAS]]:** Matrix-vector operations (e.g., matrix-vector multiplication).
    - **Level 3 [[BLAS]]:** Matrix-matrix operations (e.g., matrix multiplication).
3. **Precision Support:**
    
    - Supports single (FP32), double (FP64), half (FP16), and mixed-precision computations.
    - Utilizes **Tensor Cores** in newer GPUs for accelerated mixed-precision operations.
4. **Asynchronous Execution:**
    
    - Supports execution streams, allowing overlap of computation and data transfer.
    - Enables efficient utilization of GPU resources.
5. **Batch Operations:**
    
    - Provides batched routines for handling multiple small matrices simultaneously.
    - Useful in applications like deep learning where operations on small matrices are common.
6. **Ease of Integration:**
    
    - Designed to be easily integrated into existing applications.
    - API is similar to standard [[BLAS]] libraries, facilitating porting of code.

### **Common Use Cases**

- **Scientific Computing:**
    - Solving linear systems, eigenvalue problems, and performing numerical [[simulation]]s.
- **Machine Learning and AI:**
    - Training and inference in neural networks.
    - Commonly used in deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- **Data Analytics:**
    - Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and other algorithms that rely on linear algebra.
