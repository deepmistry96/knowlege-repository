- **XLM-R:** An extension of XLM with larger datasets and improved multilingual capabilities.

#### **Contributions:**
- **Optimized Pretraining:** RoBERTa showed how tweaking pretraining approaches, such as removing the next sentence prediction task and increasing training data, can lead to better model performance.
- **Multilingual Capabilities:** XLM and XLM-R expanded the scope of LLMs to multiple languages, promoting cross-lingual understanding and applications.

### **5. Amazon Web Services (AWS)**
#### **Models Released:**
