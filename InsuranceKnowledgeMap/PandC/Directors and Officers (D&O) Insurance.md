Directors and Officers (D&O) insurance is a type of liability insurance designed to protect individuals who serve as directors and officers of a company from personal losses if they are sued for alleged wrongful acts while managing the company. Here’s a comprehensive guide to help you understand D&O insurance:

### What is Directors and Officers (D&O) Insurance?

**Definition:** D&O insurance provides coverage for the personal liability of directors and officers of a company, as well as the entity itself, for claims made against them for alleged wrongful acts in their capacity as directors and officers.

### Key Features of D&O Insurance

1. **Coverage for Individuals:**
   - Protects the personal assets of directors and officers if they are sued for alleged wrongful acts, such as breaches of fiduciary duty, mismanagement, or failure to comply with regulations.

2. **Coverage for the Company:**
   - Covers the legal fees, settlements, and other costs incurred by the company when it indemnifies its directors and officers or when the company itself is named in the lawsuit.

3. **Claims-Made Policy:**
   - D&O insurance is typically written on a claims-made basis, meaning it covers claims made during the policy period, regardless of when the alleged wrongful act occurred, provided it happened after the retroactive date specified in the policy.

4. **Wrongful Acts:**
   - Includes a wide range of alleged wrongful acts, such as misrepresentation, negligence, errors, and omissions in the management and operation of the company.
