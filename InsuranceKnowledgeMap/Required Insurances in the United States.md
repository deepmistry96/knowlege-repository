In the United States, several types of insurance are legally required at the federal and state levels. These requirements vary depending on the specific circumstances and location. Here are the main types of insurance commonly required:

1. **[[Auto Insurance]]**:
   - **Liability Insurance**: All states except New Hampshire require drivers to have liability insurance to cover damages or injuries they cause to others in an accident. New Hampshire requires proof of financial responsibility instead.
   - **Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Coverage**: Some states require this coverage, which protects drivers if they are involved in an accident with an uninsured or underinsured driver.

2. **[[Health Insurance]]**:
   - The Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandated that most Americans have health insurance or pay a penalty. However, the federal penalty was reduced to $0 starting in 2019. Some states, like California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, have their own individual mandates with penalties for not having health insurance.

3. **[[Homeowners Insurance]]**:
   - While not legally required by the state or federal government, mortgage lenders typically require homeowners insurance as a condition of the loan to protect their investment in the property.

4. **[[Workers' Compensation Insurance]]**:
   - Most states require employers to carry workers' compensation insurance to cover medical expenses and lost wages for employees who are injured or become ill due to their job.

5. **[[Disability Insurance]]**:
   - A few states (California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island) require employers to provide short-term disability insurance to cover a portion of an employee's income if they are unable to work due to a non-work-related injury or illness.

6. **[[Professional Liability Insurance]]**:
   - Certain professions, such as doctors and lawyers, are required by some states to carry professional liability insurance (also known as malpractice insurance) to cover claims of negligence or misconduct.

7. **[[Commercial Auto Insurance]]**:
   - Businesses that use vehicles for commercial purposes are generally required to have commercial auto insurance to cover liability and property damage resulting from accidents involving their vehicles.

8. **[[Flood Insurance]]**:
   - For properties in high-risk flood zones, federally regulated or insured lenders require flood insurance as a condition of the mortgage.

While these are the most common types of legally required insurance, other requirements may exist depending on specific state laws and individual circumstances.
