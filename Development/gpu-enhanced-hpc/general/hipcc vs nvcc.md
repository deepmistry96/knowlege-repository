# Detailed Comparison of **`hipcc`** and **`[[nvcc]]`**

---

## **Introduction**

When developing GPU-accelerated applications, choosing the right compiler is crucial. **`[[nvcc]]`** is NVIDIA's CUDA compiler driver, while **`hipcc`** is AMD's compiler driver for the HIP (Heterogeneous-computing Interface for Portability) platform. Both are designed to compile code that runs on GPUs but target different platforms and have distinct features.

This guide provides an in-depth look at **`hipcc`**, how it differs from **`[[nvcc]]`**, and what these differences mean for developers.

## **Differences Between `hipcc` and `[[nvcc]]`**

### **1. Target Platforms**

- **`hipcc`:**
    - Targets both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs.
    - Provides portability across different hardware vendors.
- **`[[nvcc]]`:**
    - Targets only NVIDIA GPUs.
    - Optimized exclusively for NVIDIA hardware.

### **2. Underlying Compilers**

- **`hipcc`:**
    - For AMD GPUs: Uses **HIP-Clang** (Clang/LLVM-based).
    - For NVIDIA GPUs: Translates HIP code to CUDA and invokes **[[nvcc]]**.
- **`[[nvcc]]`:**
    - Uses NVIDIA's proprietary compiler for device code.
    - Relies on a host compiler (like GCC or MSVC) for CPU code.

### **3. Programming Models**

- **`hipcc`:**
    - Utilizes the **HIP API**, which is similar to CUDA but designed for portability.
    - HIP code can be compiled for both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs.
- **`[[nvcc]]`:**
    - Uses the **CUDA API**, specific to NVIDIA GPUs.
    - CUDA code is not inherently portable to other platforms.

### **4. Language Features and Extensions**

- **`hipcc`:**
    - Supports modern C++ standards (C++14, C++17) through Clang.
    - May have better support for advanced language features.
- **`[[nvcc]]`:**
    - Historically lagged in supporting the latest C++ standards.
    - Recent versions have improved C++ feature support.

### **5. Compilation Workflow**

- **`hipcc`:**
    - Acts as a wrapper, orchestrating the compilation process.
    - Uses Clang's capabilities to compile both host and device code.
- **`[[nvcc]]`:**
    - Separates host and device code.
    - Uses NVIDIA's compiler for device code and a host compiler for CPU code.

### **6. Command-Line Options**

- **`hipcc`:**
    - Accepts options for both AMD and NVIDIA targets.
    - Example: `--amdgpu-target` for specifying AMD GPU architecture.
- **`[[nvcc]]`:**
    - Provides options specific to NVIDIA architectures.
    - Example: `-arch=sm_75` to target a specific NVIDIA GPU.

### **7. Integration with Development Tools**

- **`hipcc`:**
    - Part of the ROCm platform with tools like `rocprof`, `rocm-gdb`.
    - Uses HIP-specific debugging and profiling tools.
- **`[[nvcc]]`:**
    - Integrated with NVIDIA's suite of tools like Nsight Compute and Nsight Systems.
    - Provides comprehensive debugging and profiling capabilities.

## **Similarities Between `hipcc` and `[[nvcc]]`**

### **1. Purpose**

- Both are compiler drivers designed to compile GPU-accelerated code.

### **2. Handling of Host and Device Code**

- Both separate and appropriately compile host (CPU) and device (GPU) code within the same source files.

### **3. Language Extensions**

- Both use extensions to standard C++ for GPU programming (e.g., `__global__`, `__device__`, `__host__`).

## **Porting Code Between CUDA and HIP**

### **Using HIPIFY**

- **hipify-clang:** A tool to convert CUDA code to HIP code automatically.

  ```bash
  hipify-clang my_program.cu -o my_program.cpp
  ```

### **Manual Adjustments**

- Replace CUDA-specific keywords with HIP equivalents:

  - `cudaMalloc` → `hipMalloc`
  - `cudaMemcpy` → `hipMemcpy`
  - `blockIdx.x` → `hipBlockIdx_x`
  - `threadIdx.x` → `hipThreadIdx_x`

### **Considerations**

- **Library Support:**

  - Some CUDA libraries may not have direct HIP equivalents.
  - ROCm provides alternatives like rocBLAS (cuBLAS equivalent), MIOpen (cuDNN equivalent).

- **Feature Differences:**

  - Hardware-specific features (like NVIDIA's Tensor Cores) may not be available on AMD GPUs.

## **Performance Considerations**

### **Optimization**

- **`[[nvcc]]`:** Optimized for NVIDIA GPUs, taking advantage of proprietary hardware features.
- **`hipcc`:** Optimized for AMD GPUs when targeting them, leveraging AMD's architectural strengths.

### **Vendor-Specific Enhancements**

- **NVIDIA GPUs:**

  - **Tensor Cores:** Accelerate mixed-precision matrix operations.
  - **RT Cores:** For ray tracing acceleration.

- **AMD GPUs:**

  - **RDNA Architectures:** May offer better performance in certain compute tasks.
  - **Infinity Cache:** Reduces memory latency for improved performance.
