# **Detailed Overview of OpenMP**

---

## **Introduction**

**OpenMP** (Open Multi-Processing) is an application programming interface (API) that supports multi-platform shared-memory parallel programming in C, C++, and Fortran. It provides a portable, scalable model that gives programmers a simple and flexible interface for developing parallel applications on platforms ranging from desktop computers to supercomputers.

**Key Objectives of OpenMP:**

- Simplify the development of parallel applications.
- Allow incremental parallelization of existing serial code.
- Provide high performance on shared-memory architectures.

## **Key Features of OpenMP**

1. **Shared Memory Parallelism:**
   - Utilizes multiple threads within a single process.
   - Threads share the same address space and can access shared variables.

2. **Compiler Directives:**
   - Pragmas or comments added to the code to specify parallel regions.
   - Minimal changes required to the existing codebase.

3. **Runtime Library Routines:**
   - Functions to control the execution environment.
   - Allows dynamic adjustment of threads, setting thread affinities, etc.

4. **Environment Variables:**
   - Control the execution of parallel programs.
   - Set the number of threads, scheduling policies, and more.

5. **Nested Parallelism:**
   - Supports parallel regions within parallel regions.
   - Enables hierarchical parallelism.

6. **Tasking Model:**
   - Introduced in OpenMP 3.0.
   - Allows for dynamic and recursive parallelism.

7. **Accelerator Support:**
   - Starting from OpenMP 4.0, support for offloading computations to accelerators like GPUs.

## **OpenMP Programming Model**

### **Execution Model**

- **Fork-Join Model:**
  - The program begins execution as a single process (master thread).
  - Upon encountering a parallel region, the master thread forks additional threads.
  - After the parallel region, threads join back into the master thread.

### **Memory Model**

- **Shared Memory:**
  - All threads can access shared variables.
  - Efficient communication via shared variables.

- **Private Variables:**
  - Each thread has its own instance of private variables.
  - Prevents race conditions and unintended data sharing.

### **Thread Synchronization**

- **Barriers:**
  - Threads wait until all have reached the barrier.
  - Ensures synchronization at specific points.

- **Critical Sections:**
  - Protects sections of code that must be executed by only one thread at a time.

- **Atomic Operations:**
  - Provides a way to perform updates to shared variables atomically.

## **OpenMP in Fortran**

OpenMP has extensive support for Fortran, making it a popular choice for parallelizing Fortran applications, especially in scientific computing domains like physics [[simulation]]s, climate modeling, and computational chemistry.

### **How to Enable OpenMP in Fortran Programs**

- **Compiler Flags:**
  - **Intel Fortran Compiler (`[[ifort]]`):** `-qopenmp` or `/Qopenmp` (Windows)
  - **GNU Fortran (`[[gfort]]ran`):** `-fopenmp`
  - **NVIDIA Fortran Compiler (`nvfortran`):** `-mp`

### **OpenMP Directives Syntax in Fortran**

- **Comment-Based Directives:**
  - Fixed Form: `C$OMP`, `!$OMP`, or `*$OMP` at the beginning of the line.
  - Free Form: `!$OMP`

- **Example:**
  ```fortran
  !$OMP parallel
    ! Parallel code here
  !$OMP end parallel
  ```

### **Common OpenMP Directives in Fortran**

1. **Parallel Region:**
   - Defines a region where code will be executed in parallel.
   ```fortran
   !$OMP parallel
     ! Code executed by all threads
   !$OMP end parallel
   ```

2. **Work-Sharing Constructs:**
   - **DO Loop Parallelism:**
     ```fortran
     !$OMP parallel do
     do i = 1, N
       ! Loop body
     end do
     ```
   - **Sections:**
     ```fortran
     !$OMP parallel sections
     !$OMP section
       ! Section 1 code
     !$OMP section
       ! Section 2 code
     !$OMP end sections
     ```

3. **Synchronization Constructs:**
   - **Barrier:**
     ```fortran
     !$OMP barrier
     ```
   - **Critical:**
     ```fortran
     !$OMP critical
       ! Code that must be executed by one thread at a time
     !$OMP end critical
     ```
   - **Atomic:**
     ```fortran
     !$OMP atomic
     variable = variable + 1
     ```

4. **Data Scope Attribute Clauses:**
   - **PRIVATE:** Each thread has its own instance.
   - **SHARED:** Variables are shared among all threads.
   - **FIRSTPRIVATE:** Like PRIVATE, but initialized with the original value.
   - **LASTPRIVATE:** Updates the variable after the last iteration.

   **Example:**
   ```fortran
   !$OMP parallel private(i) shared(a, b)
   ```

5. **Reduction Clause:**
   - Performs a reduction operation (e.g., sum, max) across threads.
   ```fortran
   !$OMP parallel do reduction(+:sum)
   do i = 1, N
     sum = sum + array(i)
   end do
   ```

## **Using OpenMP for Parallelizing Fortran Code**

### **Step-by-Step Parallelization**

1. **Identify Parallel Regions:**
   - Find loops or sections of code that can be executed in parallel without dependencies.

2. **Add OpenMP Directives:**
   - Use `!$OMP` directives to specify parallel regions and work-sharing constructs.

3. **Specify Data Scope:**
   - Determine which variables are shared or private.

4. **Compile with OpenMP Support:**
   - Use the appropriate compiler flag to enable OpenMP.

### **Example: Parallel Matrix Multiplication**

```fortran
program matrix_multiply
  implicit none
  integer, parameter :: N = 1000
  real :: A(N,N), B(N,N), C(N,N)
  integer :: i, j, k

  ! Initialize matrices A and B
  do i = 1, N
    do j = 1, N
      A(i,j) = i + j
      B(i,j) = i - j
    end do
  end do

  ! Parallel matrix multiplication
  !$OMP parallel do private(i,j,k) shared(A,B,C)
  do i = 1, N
    do j = 1, N
      C(i,j) = 0.0
      do k = 1, N
        C(i,j) = C(i,j) + A(i,k) * B(k,j)
      end do
    end do
  end do

  print *, 'Element C(1,1): ', C(1,1)
end program matrix_multiply
```

**Compilation:**
```bash
[[gfort]]ran -fopenmp matrix_multiply.f90 -o matrix_multiply
```

## **OpenMP and GPU Offloading**

Starting from OpenMP 4.0, support for accelerator offloading was introduced, allowing code to be executed on GPUs and other accelerators.

### **Target Constructs**

- **`target` Directive:**
  - Specifies that the code region should be offloaded to an accelerator.
  ```fortran
  !$OMP target
    ! Code to run on the accelerator
  !$OMP end target
  ```

- **Combined Constructs:**
  - **`target teams distribute parallel do`:**
    - Combines multiple directives for efficient GPU execution.
  ```fortran
  !$OMP target teams distribute parallel do
  do i = 1, N
    ! Loop body
  end do
  ```

### **Data Mapping Clauses**

- **`map` Clause:**
  - Controls the movement of data between the host and the device.
  - **Options:**
    - `to`: Copy data from host to device.
    - `from`: Copy data from device to host.
    - `tofrom`: Copy data both ways.
  ```fortran
  !$OMP target map(to: A) map(from: B)
  ```

### **Compiler Support for GPU Offloading**

- **NVIDIA Fortran Compiler (`nvfortran`):**
  - Supports OpenMP GPU offloading to NVIDIA GPUs.
  - Use `-mp=gpu` flag to enable.

- **GNU Fortran (`[[gfort]]ran`):**
  - Experimental support; use `-fopenmp` and additional flags.

- **Intel Fortran Compiler (`[[ifort]]`):**
  - Supports offloading to Intel GPUs and accelerators.

### **Example: Offloading a Computation to GPU**

```fortran
program saxpy
  implicit none
  integer, parameter :: N = 1000000
  real :: x(N), y(N), a
  integer :: i

  ! Initialize data
  a = 2.5
  do i = 1, N
    x(i) = i * 0.5
    y(i) = i * 0.1
  end do

  !$OMP target teams distribute parallel do map(tofrom: y) map(to: x, a)
  do i = 1, N
    y(i) = a * x(i) + y(i)
  end do

  print *, 'First element of y: ', y(1)
end program saxpy
```

**Compilation with NVIDIA Compiler:**
```bash
nvfortran -mp=gpu saxpy.f90 -o saxpy
```

  call MPI_Init(ierr)
  call MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, rank, ierr)
  call MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, size, ierr)

  !$OMP parallel private(omp_rank)
    omp_rank = omp_get_thread_num()
    ! Hybrid parallel code here
  !$OMP end parallel

  call MPI_Finalize(ierr)
end program hybrid_example
```
