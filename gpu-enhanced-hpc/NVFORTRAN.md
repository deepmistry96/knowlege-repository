## **Programming Models Supported by NVFORTRAN**

### **1. CUDA Fortran**

CUDA Fortran is an extension of Fortran that allows explicit control over GPU programming, including memory management and kernel launches. It offers fine-grained control over GPU parallelism, which is similar to CUDA C/C++.

- **GPU Kernels:** Define GPU kernels directly in Fortran using the `attributes(global)` attribute.
- **Memory Management:** Allocate device memory with `cudaMalloc` and transfer data using `cudaMemcpy`.
- **Kernel Launch Syntax:** Use familiar CUDA syntax for launching kernels, such as `<<<grid, block>>>`.

**Example:**

```fortran
attributes(global) subroutine saxpy(n, a, x, y)
    integer, value :: n
    real, value :: a
    real :: x(n), y(n)
    integer :: i
    i = threadIdx%x + (blockIdx%x-1) * blockDim%x
    if (i <= n) then
        y(i) = a * x(i) + y(i)
    endif
end subroutine saxpy

! Host code to call the GPU kernel
call saxpy <<<grid, block>>>(n, a, d_x, d_y)
```

### **2. OpenACC**

OpenACC is a directive-based parallel programming model that allows developers to offload computations to GPUs by adding `!$acc` pragmas to Fortran code.

- **Parallel Regions:** Mark code regions for parallel execution using `!$acc parallel`.
- **Data Management:** Control data movement between the host and device with directives like `!$acc data`.
- **Loop Optimization:** Annotate loops with `!$acc loop` to parallelize them on the GPU.

**Example:**

```fortran
!$acc parallel loop
do i = 1, N
    y(i) = a * x(i) + y(i)
end do
```

### **3. OpenMP Offloading**

NVFORTRAN supports OpenMP 4.5 and newer versions for offloading code to NVIDIA GPUs. OpenMP directives like `!$omp target` and `!$omp parallel` allow GPU acceleration for applications already using OpenMP for parallelism.

**Example:**

```fortran
!$omp target teams distribute parallel do
do i = 1, N
    y(i) = a * x(i) + y(i)
end do
```

## **Using CUDA Fortran in NVFORTRAN**

CUDA Fortran is similar to CUDA C/C++, allowing developers to write GPU kernels in Fortran and manage device memory explicitly.

### **Basic CUDA Fortran Syntax**

1. **Defining a GPU Kernel**

   ```fortran
   attributes(global) subroutine kernel_func()
       ! Kernel code here
   end subroutine kernel_func
   ```

2. **Memory Management**

   - Use `cudaMalloc` to allocate device memory.
   - Use `cudaMemcpy` to transfer data between host and device.

   ```fortran
   real, device :: d_A(:)
   allocate(d_A(N))
   call cudaMemcpy(d_A, h_A, N * sizeof(real), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice)
   ```

3. **Launching a Kernel**

   ```fortran
   call kernel_func <<<grid, block>>>(args)
   ```

4. **Synchronizing Execution**

   - Use `cudaDeviceSynchronize` to ensure the GPU finishes computation before moving forward.

   ```fortran
   call cudaDeviceSynchronize()
   ```

### **CUDA Fortran Example: Matrix Multiplication**

```fortran
attributes(global) subroutine matmul_kernel(A, B, C, N)
    integer, value :: N
    real :: A(N, N), B(N, N), C(N, N)
    integer :: row, col, k
    real :: sum

    row = threadIdx%x + (blockIdx%x-1) * blockDim%x
    col = threadIdx%y + (blockIdx%y-1) * blockDim%y
    if (row <= N .and. col <= N) then
        sum = 0.0
        do k = 1, N
            sum = sum + A(row, k) * B(k, col)
        end do
        C(row, col) = sum
    end if
end subroutine matmul_kernel

! Host code to allocate, initialize, and launch the kernel
```

## **Performance Optimization with NVFORTRAN**

### **1. Profile and Optimize Kernels**

Use **Nsight Compute** and **Nsight Systems** to profile kernel execution, identify bottlenecks, and optimize code for better performance. 

### **2. Memory Management**

- **Memory Coalescing:** Ensure that threads in a warp access contiguous memory locations to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
- **Data Movement:** Minimize host-to-device and device-to-host transfers. Keep data on the GPU whenever possible.

### **3. Precision Management**

- Use **mixed precision** (FP16 or FP32) where acceptable, as it can improve performance on modern GPUs that support Tensor Cores.

### **4. Utilize Shared Memory**

For data that is reused by multiple threads, use **shared memory** to reduce global memory access latency. NVFORTRAN allows you to declare shared memory in Fortran.

```fortran
attributes(shared) real :: shared_data(N)
```

### **5. Batch Processing**

For smaller matrix problems, use **batched operations** to improve GPU utilization. Batched processing groups multiple smaller problems into a single larger kernel launch.

```fortran
call cublasSgemm(handle, transA, transB, m, n, k, alpha, d_A, lda, d_B, ldb, beta, d_C, ldc)
```

### **2. cuFFT (CUDA Fast Fourier Transform)**
