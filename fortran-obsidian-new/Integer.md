**[[Declaring]]**
**This is the barebones declaration**

```fortran
Integer:: int1
```

This assigns a random value to the int1 variable. This may be possible to change via setting the default behavior in some way. This might also be different based on which [[compiler]] you are using.


**[[Instantiating]]**

N/A


**[[Initializing]]**
**This is the barebones initialization done via a [[DATA STATEMENT]]** 
```fortran
Integer :: int1 = 0
```

In this case, the [[declaration]] is done via a DATA STATEMENT. 
The benefit of doing it this way  is that you can continue to instantiate variables after this statement. 


**[[Assigning]]**

**Setting an integer**

```fortran
int1 = 10
```

This action is done by the [[executable statement]] which is typically what follows the data statements.
