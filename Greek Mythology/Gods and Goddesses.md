In many religions and mythologies, gods and goddesses are supernatural beings regarded as divine or sacred. They are typically considered to possess special powers, control natural or spiritual forces, and are often worshipped by human beings. Here are some key characteristics and roles that gods and goddesses commonly have:

### Characteristics of Gods and Goddesses

1. **Supernatural Powers**: Gods and goddesses are usually endowed with extraordinary abilities, such as controlling the weather, influencing fate, or bestowing gifts and curses upon mortals.

2. **Immortality**: Unlike humans, these divine beings are often immortal, meaning they do not age and cannot die by natural means.

3. **Anthropomorphic Features**: Many gods and goddesses are depicted with human forms and personalities, albeit with greater capabilities and virtues, or sometimes vices. This anthropomorphism helps believers and followers relate to them on a more personal level.

4. **Symbolism**: Each deity typically represents specific aspects of life, nature, or human condition. For example, a god of war might symbolize both the physical and ethical elements of conflict and bravery.

5. **Cult Worship**: They are often the focus of religious worship and rituals. This can include prayers, sacrifices, and festivals in their honor.

6. **Mythology**: Gods and goddesses are central to the myths and stories that explain the creation of the world, the origins of human institutions, moral lessons, and the mysteries of nature.

### Roles of Gods and Goddesses

- **Creators**: In many mythologies, gods and goddesses are creators of the world or universe, sculpting the earth, stars, and sometimes other gods and living beings.

- **Protectors**: They often act as protectors of humans, cities, nations, or even specific professions and areas of life, such as travel, love, or the harvest.

- **Judges**: Many are seen as judges of moral character, particularly in afterlife beliefs where they assess the souls of the deceased.

- **Interveners**: They may intervene in human affairs, responding to prayers, offering omens, or participating directly in events to enforce their will or support their followers.

The understanding and interpretation of gods and goddesses can vary widely among different cultures and religions. In polytheistic religions, like ancient Greek, Roman, and Norse mythologies, there is a pantheon of multiple gods and goddesses, each with distinct domains and narratives. In monotheistic religions, such as Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, the focus is on a single, all-powerful deity who fulfills many of these roles alone.
