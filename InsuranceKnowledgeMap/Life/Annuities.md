An annuity is a financial product that provides a stream of payments in exchange for an initial investment. It is typically used as a retirement strategy, providing income during the retirement years. Annuities are usually sold by [[insurance]] companies and can be structured in various ways depending on the needs and goals of the buyer. Here are the key features and types of annuities:

### Key Features
- **Income for Life or for a Set Period**: An annuity can provide guaranteed income for the rest of your life or for a specified period.
- **Initial Investment**: This can be a lump-sum payment or a series of payments.
- **Payment Schedule**: The income from an annuity can be distributed monthly, quarterly, annually, or in a lump sum, depending on the terms of the contract.

### Types of Annuities

1. **Immediate Annuities**: With an immediate annuity, the annuitant pays a lump sum upfront and starts receiving payments after a very short period, typically within a year from the purchase date. This is suitable for retirees who need income right away.

2. **Deferred Annuities**: These start payments at a future date. The money invested grows tax-deferred until it is withdrawn, either as a lump sum or as periodic payments. This type is useful for long-term retirement planning.

### Further Classification Based on Investment Risk and Return
- **Fixed Annuities**: Provide regular, guaranteed payments that do not change in amount. The insurer guarantees both the principal investment and a fixed interest rate.
  
- **Variable Annuities**: Allow the annuitant to invest the principal in various securities such as mutual funds. The payments depend on the performance of these investments, hence there is a higher risk but also a potential for higher returns.
  
- **Indexed Annuities**: Offer returns that are tied to a market index (like the S&P 500), but with certain protections against market loss. Payments vary based on the index performance, but there is typically a guaranteed minimum return.

### Considerations
- **Fees and Expenses**: Annuities can have high fees, including management fees, mortality and expense risk charges, and surrender charges if you withdraw money early.
- **Tax Implications**: The money invested in an annuity grows tax-deferred, which means you don’t pay taxes on the earnings until you withdraw them. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
- **Insurance Elements**: Since annuities are offered by insurance companies, they often include options like death benefits, where a designated beneficiary receives a payment upon the annuitant’s death.

Annuities can be a useful tool for managing retirement income, but due to their complexity and costs, they may not be suitable for everyone. It's important to understand your financial needs, the specific terms of the annuity, and to consult with a financial advisor to ensure that an annuity fits into your overall financial plan.
