# **Comprehensive Overview of CUDA: History, Implementation, and Popularity**

---

## **Introduction**

**CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture)** is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by **NVIDIA**. It enables software developers to use a CUDA-enabled graphics processing unit (GPU) for general-purpose processingâ€”an approach termed **GPGPU (General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units)**. Since its introduction in 2007, CUDA has revolutionized high-performance computing by providing developers with direct access to the GPU's virtual instruction set and parallel computational elements.
