IRimage is an open-source software designed for processing images from infrared thermal cameras. It is specifically aimed at increasing throughput, accuracy, and reproducibility of results obtained from these images. A key aspect of IRimage is its ability to process thermal images by extracting raw data and calculating temperature values using a fully documented algorithm. This makes the data suitable for further processing with image analysis software.

The software is particularly focused on enhancing the use of affordable, consumer-oriented cameras for thermal imaging. This focus implies that it makes advanced thermal imaging techniques more accessible to a broader audience who might be using less expensive equipment.

IRimage's capabilities include making reproducible measurements of the temperature of objects in a series of images. This feature is crucial for applications that require consistent and accurate temperature readings across multiple images.

The software has been tested and shown to produce results consistent with those of standard software for various camera models. One of the use cases highlighted for IRimage is its application in efficiently processing hundreds of thermal images to reveal subtle differences in the daily pattern of leaf temperature of plants subjected to different soil conditions. This example underscores the software's potential in scientific and environmental research, where detailed and accurate thermal analysis is required​ ([NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9138121/#:~:text=IRimage%20processes%20thermal%20images%2C%20extracting,processing%20using%20image%20analysis%20software))​​ ([GitHub](https://github.com/gpereyrairujo/IRimage#:~:text=IRimage%20Open%20source%20software%20for,oriented%20cameras))​​ ([{{ngMeta['og:title']}}](https://bio.tools/irimage#!#:~:text=IRimage%3A%20Open%20source%20software%20for,oriented%20cameras))​​ ([Scholar.ai](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/IRimage%3A-open-source-software-for-processing-images-Irujo/92f84f255b4e79b046957a27323c19e1ad73543e#:~:text=IRimage%20processes%20thermal%20images%2C%20extracting,accuracy%20and%20reproducibility%20of))​​ ([RI CONICET](https://ri.conicet.gov.ar/handle/11336/209733#:~:text=IRimage%E2%80%99s%20results%20were%20consistent%20with,subjected%20to%20different%20soil))​.

Radiometric [[JPEG]] (often referred to as RJPG or R-[[JPEG]]) files are a type of image file used primarily in thermal imaging. These files are unique because they contain not only the visual representation of the thermal image but also the raw temperature data for each pixel in the image. This dual nature makes radiometric JPEGs particularly valuable in applications where thermal data is critical, such as in scientific research, engineering, and various industrial applications. Here are some key aspects of radiometric [[JPEG]] files:

1. **Dual Data Storage**: Unlike standard [[JPEG]], which only store visual data (essentially, the colors of each pixel), radiometric JPEGs store both the visual representation and the temperature value of each pixel. This means that you can see the image as a thermal photograph while also being able to analyze the precise temperature readings at any point in the image.
    
2. **Analysis and Post-Processing**: Because they contain raw temperature data, radiometric JPEGs can be analyzed and processed after the image has been captured. Users can adjust parameters like emissivity, reflected temperature, and humidity to recalibrate the temperature readings in the image, which is not possible with standard thermal images.
    
3. **Compatibility with [[Thermal Imaging]] Cameras and Software**: Radiometric JPEGs are commonly used with thermal imaging cameras. Many such cameras have the option to save images in this format. Additionally, specialized software can be used to view and analyze these files, extracting and manipulating the temperature data as needed.
    
4. **Applications**: They are widely used in fields like building inspection (to detect heat leaks), electrical maintenance (to identify overheating components), medical imaging, meteorology, and environmental studies. Their ability to provide detailed thermal information makes them invaluable for diagnostic and research purposes.
    
5. **File Size and Compression**: Radiometric [[JPEG]] files are typically larger than standard JPEGs due to the additional temperature data. However, they are still compressed files, which means they take up less space than raw thermal data formats.
    

In summary, radiometric [[JPEG]] files are a sophisticated tool in thermal imaging, combining the visual clarity of a photograph with the detailed temperature data of a thermal sensor. This combination makes them extremely useful in any application where detailed temperature readings are as important as the visual layout of the scene.
