In Greek mythology, the Titans are a race of powerful deities who ruled during the legendary Golden Age before the Olympians, a younger generation of gods, took power. The Titans are the children of Uranus (the sky) and Gaia (the earth), and they embody various elements of the world.

### Key Titans
Here are some of the most prominent Titans:

1. **Cronus ([[Kronos]])** - The leader of the Titans, who overthrew his father Uranus at the instigation of his mother Gaia. Cronus is associated with the harvest and is often depicted with a sickle. He swallowed his children to prevent a prophecy that predicted his downfall, but Zeus, one of his sons, eventually overthrew him.

2. **[[Rhea]]** - Sister and wife of Cronus, mother of the first generation of Olympian gods, including Zeus, Hades, Poseidon, Hera, Demeter, and Hestia. She tricked Cronus to save Zeus, leading to the overthrow of Cronus.

3. **[[Oceanus]]** - Titan of the ocean, represented as a great river encircling the earth. Unlike many Titans, Oceanus did not participate in the Titanomachy and thus was not punished.

4. **[[Tethys]]** - Wife of Oceanus and goddess of the sources of fresh water, which feed the earth. She is the mother of the rivers (Potamoi), the clouds, and the three thousand ocean nymphs (Oceanids).

5. **[[Hyperion]]** - Titan of light, father of the celestial bodies, including Helios (Sun), Selene (Moon), and Eos (Dawn).

6. **[[Theia]]** - Consort of Hyperion, associated with sight and the shining light of the clear blue sky. Mother of Helios, Selene, and Eos.

7. **[[Coeus]]** - Titan of intellect and the axis of heaven around which the constellations revolved. He is the father of Leto and Asteria.

8. **[[Phoebe]]** - Titaness of the bright intellect and prophecy, associated with the moon. She is the grandmother of Apollo and Artemis through her daughter Leto.

9. **[[Iapetus]]** - Associated with craftsmanship and mortality, father of several Titans including Prometheus, Epimetheus, Atlas, and Menoetius.

10. **[[Themis]]** - Titaness of divine law and order. She is often represented as the embodiment of divine justice, law, and customs.

11. **[[Mnemosyne]]** - Titaness of memory and the mother of the Muses by Zeus.

12. **[[Atlas]]** - Son of Iapetus, who led a Titan rebellion against Zeus and as punishment was condemned to hold up the sky on his shoulders.

### Titanomachy
The Titans were overthrown by the younger Olympians in a ten-year conflict known as the Titanomachy. This war concluded with many of the Titans being imprisoned in Tartarus, a deep abyss used as a dungeon.

### Cultural Impact
The Titans represent enormous, primordial forces that personify different aspects of nature. Their stories are deeply integrated into Greek mythology's themes of struggle, power, and transition from one era to another, reflecting the dynamics between generations and the inevitable change of power.
