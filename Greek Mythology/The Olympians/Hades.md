Hades is one of the major deities in Greek mythology, known primarily as the god of the underworld, a role through which he oversees the realm of the dead. He is one of the three sons of the Titans Cronus and Rhea, alongside his brothers [[Zeus]], the king of the gods, and Poseidon, the god of the sea.

### Key Aspects of Hades

- **[[God of the Underworld]]**: Hades rules over the underworld, the place where the souls of the deceased go. His domain is often called simply "Hades," which can refer to both the deity and the realm.

- **[[Judgment of Souls]]**: In his role as the ruler of the underworld, Hades, alongside other figures such as Minos, Rhadamanthus, and Aeacus, judges the souls of the dead and assigns them their place in the underworld.

- **[[Wealth and Fertility]]**: Hades is also associated with wealth and the fertility of the earth, particularly in terms of precious metals and fertile soil. This aspect is sometimes referred to by the epithet "Plouton," which means "wealth-giver" and is the basis for the Roman name Pluto.

- **[[Zeus' Invisibility Helmet]]**: One of Hades' iconic attributes is the helmet of invisibility, which he uses to move unseen, both among the living and the dead.

### The Myth of [[Persephone]]

Hades is perhaps best known for the myth of Persephone, his abduction of the daughter of Demeter, which leads to her becoming his wife and the queen of the underworld. This story is central to many religious rites in ancient Greece, particularly the Eleusinian Mysteries, which were major festivals held in honor of Demeter and Persephone, celebrating the mysteries of death and rebirth.

### Personality and Perception

Unlike many depictions of death deities in other mythologies, Hades is not typically shown as evil. Instead, he is more often portrayed as stern, just, and inexorable, maintaining balance and order in the underworld. He is less involved in the affairs of Olympus and mortal beings compared to other gods, preferring to remain in his own domain.

Hades' character illustrates the ancient Greeks' understanding of death not as something necessarily malevolent but as an inevitable and natural aspect of life's cycle.
