The Hecatoncheires, also known as the Hundred-Handed Ones, are a group of figures in Greek mythology known for their extraordinary features and formidable power. Their name directly translates to "hundred-handed," which is indicative of their most notable characteristic: each of them had a hundred arms and fifty heads.

### Origins and Family
The Hecatoncheires are three brothers: **[[Briareus]] (also known as Aegaeon), [[Cottus]], and [[Gyges]] (or Gyes)**. They were the children of Uranus (Sky) and Gaia (Earth), making them siblings to the Titans and the Cyclopes. The Hecatoncheires are among the earliest creatures born from the primordial elements of the universe, embodying the chaotic and vast powers of nature.

### Role in Mythology
- **Imprisonment**: Uranus, horrified by their monstrous appearances, imprisoned the Hecatoncheires in Tartarus, deep within the earth. This act contributed to the resentment Gaia held against Uranus, eventually leading to his overthrow by the Titans.
- **Liberation and Battle**: During the [[Titanomachy]], the cosmic battle between the Titans and the Olympians, [[Zeus]] freed the [[Hecatoncheires]] from [[Tartarus]]. Grateful for their liberation, they joined Zeus in the fight against the [[Titans]]. Their immense strength and the overwhelming power of their hundred arms were crucial in securing victory for the [[Olympians]]. They hurled massive rocks and boulders at the Titans, effectively turning the tide of the battle.
- **Aftermath**: After the defeat of the Titans, the Hecatoncheires were given the role of guarding the prisoners in Tartarus. Briareus, one of the brothers, also served as an arbiter among the gods, respected for his strength and fairness.

### Significance
The Hecatoncheires represent raw, untamed forces of nature and the chaotic potential that exists in the world. Their loyalty to Zeus and their role in maintaining the order of the cosmos after the [[Titanomachy]] underscore themes of justice and retribution in Greek mythology. Their incredible power and grotesque form also highlight the Greeks' fascination with the monstrous and the boundaries between the civilized world and the unknown.
