### **Example: Adaptive Headlights Using CAN Bus**

Let's walk through a **toy example** of how **adaptive headlights** function using the **CAN Bus** in a simplified scenario:

### **Vehicle Information:**
- **Vehicle**: Mid-size sedan with adaptive headlights
- **Sensors**: Speed sensor, steering angle sensor, camera system
- **Headlight Type**: Matrix LED headlights with individual LED control
- **Control System**: Electronic Control Unit (ECU) communicates via CAN Bus

### **Scenario**:
The vehicle is driving on a **winding road** at night, with occasional oncoming traffic, and adaptive headlights are used to improve visibility while avoiding glare for other drivers.

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown**:

1. **ECU Sends Data via CAN Bus**:
   - As the vehicle drives, the **Electronic Control Unit (ECU)** continuously gathers data from various sensors, including:
     - **Speed Sensor**: The vehicle is traveling at 60 km/h.
     - **Steering Angle Sensor**: The driver is turning the steering wheel to the right for a bend in the road.
     - **Camera System**: Detects an oncoming car approaching in the opposite lane.

   - This data is transmitted via the **CAN Bus** to the **Headlight Control Module**.

   **CAN Bus Message**:
   ```
   Message 1: 
   Speed = 60 km/h 
   Steering Angle = 10 degrees right 
   Oncoming Vehicle Detected = True
   ```

2. **Headlight Control Module Processes Data**:
   - The **Headlight Control Module** receives the **CAN Bus message** and processes the data to decide how the headlights should be adjusted:
     - **Speed**: Since the vehicle is traveling at 60 km/h, the module determines that the **beam range** needs to be extended for high-speed driving.
     - **Steering Angle**: The module recognizes that the steering wheel is turned 10 degrees to the right, so it decides to **pivot the headlight beam** to the right to illuminate the curve.
     - **Oncoming Vehicle Detected**: The camera system has detected an oncoming vehicle. The module will adjust the **matrix LEDs** to reduce glare by dimming specific LED segments.

3. **Control Module Adjusts the Headlights**:
   - Based on the processed data, the **Headlight Control Module** sends signals to the **headlight leveling motor** and **matrix LED controller** to make real-time adjustments:
     - **Beam Position**: The module sends a signal to the leveling motor to **swivel** the headlight beam 10 degrees to the right, following the curve in the road.
     - **Beam Range**: The module adjusts the brightness and range of the headlights to **extend the beam** for better visibility at high speed.
     - **Matrix LED Control**: To prevent blinding the oncoming driver, the module dims or turns off the **LED segments** that would otherwise shine directly into the oncoming car’s path. The rest of the LEDs continue to illuminate the road and surroundings.

   **Headlight Control Signals**:
   ```
   Signal 1: Adjust beam to 10 degrees right
   Signal 2: Extend beam range for high speed (60 km/h)
   Signal 3: Dim LEDs on the left to avoid glare for oncoming vehicle
   ```

4. **Real-Time Adjustments Based on Changing Conditions**:
   - As the vehicle continues through the curve, the **steering angle** and **speed** may change. These changes are continuously relayed via the CAN Bus to the headlight control module, which updates the headlight settings in real-time.
   - Once the vehicle exits the curve and the road straightens, the steering angle sensor returns to **0 degrees**, and the headlights **re-center** themselves to illuminate the road ahead.
   - When the oncoming vehicle passes, the camera no longer detects it, and the headlight control module **reactivates the full LED array** for maximum visibility.

   **New CAN Bus Message**:
   ```
   Message 2: 
   Speed = 60 km/h 
   Steering Angle = 0 degrees (straight) 
   Oncoming Vehicle Detected = False
   ```

   - The headlight beam is now directed straight ahead, and the matrix LED system returns to full brightness, illuminating both sides of the road.

### **Summary of the Process**:

1. **CAN Bus Data Exchange**:
   - The **ECU** sends real-time data (speed, steering angle, oncoming vehicle detection) via the **CAN Bus** to the **headlight control module**.

2. **Headlight Control Module Decision**:
   - The **headlight control module** processes the data and makes decisions on how to adjust the **beam angle**, **beam range**, and **matrix LED segments**.

3. **Headlight Adjustments**:
   - The control module sends signals to the **headlight leveling motor** to adjust the **angle** and **range**, and to the **matrix LED controller** to dim or activate specific LED segments, ensuring optimal visibility without causing glare for oncoming drivers.

This example illustrates how **adaptive headlights** work seamlessly with the vehicle’s onboard sensors and control systems, using the **CAN Bus** to manage data exchange and real-time adjustments.
