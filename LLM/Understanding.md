### **[[Understanding]]: The Human Perspective**

In contrast, human understanding involves a deeper cognitive process:

- **[[Comprehension]]:** Humans understand language by comprehending the meaning behind words, phrases, and sentences. This comprehension involves grasping the context, intent, nuances, and implications of language.

- **[[Contextual Awareness]]:** Human understanding includes the ability to interpret language based on cultural, emotional, and situational contexts. People can infer meaning that goes beyond the literal words, such as sarcasm, irony, or implied messages.

- **[[Conscious Reasoning and Judgment]]:** Humans use reasoning and judgment to evaluate the accuracy, relevance, and appropriateness of information. They can draw from personal experiences, knowledge, and ethical considerations to interpret language meaningfully.
