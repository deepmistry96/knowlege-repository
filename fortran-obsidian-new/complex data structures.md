Here are some complex data structures commonly used in computer programming, especially in mathematics and science, that prioritize speed, memory usage, and can leverage parallel processing:

1. **Segment Trees**: Useful for range queries and updates, often used in computational geometry and optimization problems. They allow for efficient querying and updating of array intervals, leveraging parallel processing to handle multiple segments simultaneously.
    
2. **Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees)**: Efficient for cumulative frequency tables and range queries, particularly in scenarios requiring frequent updates. They offer a space-efficient alternative to segment trees and are suitable for parallel processing in specific applications.
    
3. **Sparse Matrices**: Commonly used in scientific computing and machine learning, sparse matrices store only non-zero elements, which reduces memory usage and allows for efficient matrix operations. Libraries like SciPy in Python optimize sparse matrix operations, often utilizing parallel processing.
    
4. **Suffix Arrays and Trees**: Widely used in bioinformatics, string matching, and data compression. They are optimized for memory usage and can handle parallel processing for tasks like pattern matching across large datasets.
    
5. **k-d Trees (k-dimensional Trees)**: Used in multidimensional space partitioning, often in nearest neighbor searches and machine learning. These trees support efficient searching and can be parallelized for tasks involving large datasets.
    
6. **Quadtree/Octree**: Spatial data structures used in computer graphics, geographic information systems (GIS), and physics simulations. They efficiently manage hierarchical data and can be parallelized for large-scale simulations.
    
7. **Bloom Filters**: A probabilistic data structure used to test whether an element is part of a set, often seen in network systems and databases. They are memory-efficient and support parallel processing for high-throughput applications.
    
8. **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)**: Optimized for dynamic connectivity problems, such as network connectivity and image processing. It uses path compression and union by rank to achieve near-constant time complexity and can be parallelized in certain scenarios.
    
9. **Graph Matrices (Adjacency Matrices and Laplacian Matrices)**: Used in graph theory and network analysis, where the matrix representation of graphs allows for efficient operations using linear algebra techniques that are parallelizable, especially with GPUs.
