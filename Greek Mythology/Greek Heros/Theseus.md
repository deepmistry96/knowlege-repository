Theseus is one of the most famous heroes in Greek mythology, known for his numerous adventures and his role in unifying the region of Attica under Athens. His story encompasses themes of bravery, intelligence, and justice. Here’s an in-depth look at Theseus:

### Key Information about Theseus

#### Origins and Family
1. **Parentage**:
   - Theseus is the son of Aegeus, the king of Athens, and Aethra, the daughter of King Pittheus of Troezen. In some versions of the myth, Theseus is also considered to be the son of Poseidon, who had an affair with Aethra on the same night she was with Aegeus.

2. **Early Life**:
   - Theseus was raised in Troezen by his mother. When he came of age, he lifted a heavy rock under which his father had placed a sword and sandals as tokens of his heritage. This marked the beginning of his journey to Athens to claim his birthright.

### Major Adventures and Deeds

#### Journey to Athens
1. **Six Labors**:
   - On his way to Athens, Theseus encountered and defeated six notorious criminals and monsters:
     - **Periphetes (the Club-Bearer)**: Theseus killed Periphetes, who used a club to kill travelers, and took the club as his weapon.
     - **Sinis (the Pine-Bender)**: Sinis would bend pine trees and catapult victims to their deaths. Theseus defeated him using his own method.
     - **The Crommyonian Sow**: A wild pig that ravaged the region. Theseus killed the beast.
     - **Sciron**: A robber who forced travelers to wash his feet and then kicked them into the sea where a giant turtle devoured them. Theseus threw Sciron off the cliff instead.
     - **Cercyon**: A wrestler who killed his opponents. Theseus defeated him in a wrestling match.
     - **Procrustes**: A sadistic host who adjusted his guests to fit his bed by stretching or cutting them. Theseus killed him using his own method.

#### Arrival in Athens
1. **Recognition and Acceptance**:
   - Upon arriving in Athens, Theseus was initially unrecognized by his father Aegeus. However, after showing the tokens, he was acknowledged as the prince.
   - Theseus then thwarted an attempt by Medea, Aegeus’s wife, to poison him.

#### The Minotaur and the Labyrinth
1. **Tribute to Crete**:
   - Athens was required to send seven young men and seven young women to Crete every nine years as tribute to King Minos. These tributes were sacrificed to the Minotaur, a half-man, half-bull creature, kept in a labyrinth designed by Daedalus.

2. **Theseus’s Volunteer**:
   - Determined to end the tributes, Theseus volunteered to go to Crete. With the help of Ariadne, Minos’s daughter, who fell in love with him, Theseus was given a ball of thread (Ariadne’s thread) to navigate the labyrinth.

3. **Slaying the Minotaur**:
   - Theseus entered the labyrinth, found the Minotaur, and killed it with his bare hands or a sword. He then used the thread to find his way back out.

4. **Return to Athens**:
   - On the way back to Athens, Theseus abandoned Ariadne on the island of Naxos, where she was later found and married by the god Dionysus.
   - Tragically, Theseus forgot to change the sails of his ship from black to white (a signal to his father that he was returning safely). Seeing the black sails, Aegeus believed Theseus was dead and threw himself into the sea, which was thereafter called the Aegean Sea.

#### Later Adventures and Reign

   - Theseus formed a close friendship with Pirithous, king of the Lapiths. Together, they went on several adventures, including the abduction of Helen (before she was of age to marry) and an ill-fated attempt to kidnap Persephone from the Underworld. Theseus was imprisoned in the Underworld until Heracles rescued him.
