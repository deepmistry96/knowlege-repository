The Parthenon is one of the most iconic and enduring symbols of ancient Greek civilization. It is a temple dedicated to the goddess Athena, whom the people of Athens considered their patron. Constructed in the 5th century BCE during the height of the Athenian Empire, the Parthenon stands on the Acropolis of Athens and exemplifies the architectural and artistic achievements of classical Greece. Here’s an in-depth look at the Parthenon:

### Key Information about the Parthenon

#### Historical Background
1. **Construction**:
   - The Parthenon was constructed between 447 and 432 BCE during the leadership of Pericles, a prominent Athenian statesman. The architects Ictinus and Callicrates designed the temple, and the renowned sculptor Phidias oversaw the artistic decoration.

2. **Purpose**:
   - The Parthenon was built to honor Athena Parthenos (Athena the Virgin) and to celebrate the glory of Athens following the Persian Wars. It served both religious and civic functions, housing a massive statue of Athena and serving as a treasury.

#### Architectural Features

1. **Design and Structure**:
   - The Parthenon is a Doric temple with some Ionic features. It measures approximately 69.5 meters (228 feet) in length and 30.9 meters (101 feet) in width, with a height of about 13.72 meters (45 feet).
   - It features a rectangular floor plan with a series of columns surrounding the entire structure. There are 8 columns on each end (east and west) and 17 columns along each side (north and south).

2. **Columns and Entablature**:
   - The Doric columns are fluted and have simple capitals. The entablature above the columns includes a frieze decorated with triglyphs and metopes, which are sculpted panels depicting various mythological scenes.

3. **The Pediments**:
   - The east and west pediments of the Parthenon were adorned with intricate sculptures. The east pediment depicted the birth of Athena from the head of Zeus, while the west pediment showed the contest between Athena and Poseidon for the patronage of Athens.

4. **The Frieze**:
   - The Parthenon frieze is an inner continuous Ionic frieze that runs around the upper part of the cella (the inner chamber). It is believed to depict the Panathenaic Procession, a religious festival held in honor of Athena.

5. **The Statue of Athena**:
   - Inside the Parthenon stood a colossal statue of Athena Parthenos, created by Phidias. The statue was made of gold and ivory (chryselephantine) and depicted Athena holding a shield and a small statue of Nike (Victory) in her right hand.

#### Cultural and Religious Significance

1. **Religious Center**:

3. **Artistic Masterpiece**:
   - The Parthenon is considered an artistic masterpiece, epitomizing classical Greek ideals of beauty, harmony, and proportion. Its architectural refinements, such as slight curvature of the columns and stylobate (the platform on which the columns stand), correct optical illusions and enhance its aesthetic appeal.

### Historical Transformations

1. **Conversion and Preservation**:
   - Over the centuries, the Parthenon underwent several transformations. In the 6th century CE, it was converted into a Christian church dedicated to the Virgin Mary. During the Ottoman period, it became a mosque.
