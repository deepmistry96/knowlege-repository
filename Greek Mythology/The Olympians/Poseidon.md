### Notable Myths Involving Poseidon

**1. Contest for Athens:**
   - Poseidon competed with Athena for patronage of the city of Athens. He struck the Acropolis with his trident, creating a saltwater spring, while Athena offered the olive tree. The Athenians chose Athena’s gift, finding it more useful, thus naming the city after her.

**2. The [[Trojan War]]:**
   - Poseidon played a significant role in the Trojan War. Initially, he supported the Greeks but was also respected by the Trojans who were skilled horsemen.

**3. The Birth of Pegasus:**
   - Poseidon, in the form of a horse, fathered Pegasus with the Gorgon Medusa, and the winged horse sprang from her neck when she was beheaded by Perseus—a myth that illustrates his connection to horses and heroic tales.

**4. The Walls of Troy:**
   - Poseidon and Apollo, once forced to serve King Laomedon of Troy, built the massive walls around the city as a punishment from Zeus. However, Laomedon refused to pay them for this task, earning their wrath and leading to the god's support for the Greek side during the Trojan War.

### Worship and Cult

Poseidon was widely venerated across Greece but particularly in coastal locations. He had many sanctuaries and temples dedicated to him, with his primary cult center at the Isthmus of Corinth, which hosted the Isthmian Games, one of the major Panhellenic festivals that included chariot races, reflecting his connection to horses.

Poseidon's worship was integral to ancient Greeks, especially for those whose lives and livelihoods were tied to the sea. His moods were believed to reflect the state of the sea—calm or stormy—highlighting his immense influence over both the natural and human world.
