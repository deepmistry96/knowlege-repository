Zeus is one of the most important figures in ancient Greek mythology, recognized as the king of the gods. He rules over Mount Olympus and presides over the sky and thunder, wielding immense power and authority among both deities and mortals. Hereâ€™s a detailed look at Zeus:

### Origins and Family
Zeus is the youngest son of the Titans Cronus and Rhea. According to mythology, Cronus, fearing that he would be overthrown by his children just as he overthrew his own father Uranus, swallowed each of his children at birth. However, Rhea hid Zeus at birth and tricked Cronus into swallowing a rock wrapped in swaddling clothes instead. Zeus was raised in secrecy and eventually grew up to challenge and defeat Cronus, thus liberating his siblings, who were still alive in Cronus's stomach.

### Role and Symbolism
