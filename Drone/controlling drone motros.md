There's a minimum speed that the motors need to be at in order for the motors to spin. It looks like that speed is going to be an increase in 25 over The baseline static value. Normally that static state value is 1000 with zero being the minimum 2000 being the maximum. 

There are a couple flight modes that we can engage in on the drone in the with the flight controller. It seems like arrow trainer in horizon are the two modes that we want to use. 

There is a flight mode called disabled, but I am not sure what it does. It looks like it doesn't really do much. 

The repos that we are working out of are

/users/deepmistry/repos/yamspy - This repository is for being able to use a PS4 controller to control a drone flight controller

/users/deepmistry/repos/testing_on_mac - Testing on Mac is an intermediate place where some software is living but it's not a permanent home. It's just a temporary integration space for us to put a bunch of pieces of software together.

/users/deepmistry/repos/albatross-c2i - Albatross C2I is going to be the final repository that we're going to be using to develop the drone. I think the latest code is going to live there and as things mature they will migrate from other temporary repositories into the albatross-c2i. The C2I is to play on the military Naming scheme where they use things like C2 for command control, and I for intelligence or information.
