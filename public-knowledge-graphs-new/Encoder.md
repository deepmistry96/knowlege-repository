An Encoder is a device that converts the active data signal into a coded message format or it is a device that converts analogue signal to digital signals. It is a combinational circuit, that converts binary information in the form of 2N input lines into N output lines which represent N bit code for the input. When an input signal is applied to an encoder the logic circuitry involved within it converts that particular input into coded binary output.
