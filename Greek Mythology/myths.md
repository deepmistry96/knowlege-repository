In Greek mythology, myths are traditional stories that were created to explain natural phenomena, human behavior, and cultural practices, as well as to convey the spiritual and moral beliefs of ancient Greeks. These myths often involve supernatural beings such as gods, goddesses, and heroes, and they typically aim to address universal questions, conflicts, and themes.

### Characteristics of Greek Myths:
- **Symbolism**: Myths often use symbols to represent more complex ideas or values. For instance, Zeus's lightning bolt symbolizes power and authority.
- **Moral Lessons**: Many myths carry moral or philosophical messages that reflect the values of ancient Greek society.
- **Explanatory Function**: Myths frequently explain the origins of natural phenomena (like the change of seasons in the myth of [[Persephone]] and [[Hades]]) or cultural rituals.
- **Entertainment Value**: Myths were also told for entertainment, filled with drama, romance, conflict, and adventure.
- **Involvement of the Divine**: Gods and goddesses play crucial roles in these stories, often interacting with humans and influencing their lives directly.

Greek myths were part of an oral tradition before being written down by poets such as [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]]. This oral nature allowed myths to evolve over time, with different versions and interpretations appearing in various regions. These stories served not only as religious instruction but also as foundational tales for Greek culture, shaping ancient Greek identity and worldview.
