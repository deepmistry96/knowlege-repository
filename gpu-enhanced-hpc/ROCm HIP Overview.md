## **1. Introduction to HIP**

**HIP** is a C++ runtime API and kernel language that provides a portable, high-performance programming environment for GPU computing. It allows developers to write code that can run on both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs, simplifying the development process and reducing maintenance overhead.

**Key Objectives of HIP:**

- **Portability**: Enable applications to run on multiple GPU architectures without code changes.
- **Performance**: Achieve near-native performance on both AMD and NVIDIA hardware.
- **Productivity**: Provide a familiar programming environment for CUDA developers.

---

## **2. HIP and ROCm Platform**

**ROCm** is AMD's open-source platform for GPU-accelerated computing, encompassing a range of software components, including drivers, runtime APIs, and development tools.

**HIP's Role in ROCm:**

- **Core Component**: HIP serves as the primary programming model within the ROCm ecosystem.
- **Interoperability**: Integrates with other ROCm libraries and tools, such as math libraries and debugging utilities.
- **Open-Source**: Available on GitHub, allowing community contributions and transparency.

---

## **3. Portability Between AMD and NVIDIA GPUs**

**How HIP Achieves Portability:**

- **API Compatibility**: HIP's API is similar to CUDA's, enabling code to be written in a way that is compatible with both platforms.
- **Conditional Compilation**: Allows code to target specific platforms when necessary.
- **Backend Support**:
  - **AMD GPUs**: Uses ROCm runtime and drivers.
  - **NVIDIA GPUs**: Utilizes the CUDA runtime and drivers through the HIPCUDA backend.

**Benefits:**

- **Single Codebase**: Maintain one set of source code for both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs.
- **Ease of Porting**: Simplifies the process of bringing existing CUDA applications to AMD hardware.
- **Vendor Neutrality**: Reduces dependence on a single hardware vendor.

---

## **4. HIP Programming Model**

HIP provides both a **kernel language** for writing GPU kernels and a **runtime API** for managing GPU resources.

### **Kernel Language**

- **C++ with Extensions**: HIP kernels are written in C++ with minimal extensions.
- **Syntax Similarity**: Kernel syntax is nearly identical to CUDA, making it familiar to CUDA developers.
- **Execution Configuration**: Uses the same triple chevron `<<<...>>>` syntax for launching kernels.

**Example Kernel:**

```cpp
__global__ void vector_add(const float* A, const float* B, float* C, size_t N) {
    size_t idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (idx < N) {
        C[idx] = A[idx] + B[idx];
    }
}
```

### **Runtime API**

- **Device Management**: Functions to query and control GPU devices.
- **Memory Management**: Allocate and manage memory on the host and device.
- **Stream and Event Management**: Control execution order and synchronize tasks.
- **Error Handling**: Functions to handle and report errors.

**Example API Usage:**

```cpp
// Allocate device memory
float *d_A, *d_B, *d_C;
hipMalloc(&d_A, N * sizeof(float));
hipMalloc(&d_B, N * sizeof(float));
hipMalloc(&d_C, N * sizeof(float));

// Copy data from host to device
hipMemcpy(d_A, h_A, N * sizeof(float), hipMemcpyHostToDevice);
hipMemcpy(d_B, h_B, N * sizeof(float), hipMemcpyHostToDevice);

// Launch kernel
int blockSize = 256;
int gridSize = (N + blockSize - 1) / blockSize;
hipLaunchKernelGGL(vector_add, dim3(gridSize), dim3(blockSize), 0, 0, d_A, d_B, d_C, N);

// Copy result back to host
hipMemcpy(h_C, d_C, N * sizeof(float), hipMemcpyDeviceToHost);

// Free device memory
hipFree(d_A);
hipFree(d_B);
hipFree(d_C);
```

## **5. Tools and Compilers**

### **HIPCC Compiler**

- **Compiler Wrapper**: `hipcc` is a compiler driver that wraps around underlying compilers.
- **Backend Selection**:
  - **AMD GPUs**: Uses the HCC or Clang-based compiler targeting ROCm.
  - **NVIDIA GPUs**: Uses NVCC, NVIDIA's CUDA compiler.
- **Usage**:
  - Automatically handles the selection of the appropriate backend based on the target platform.
  - Simplifies the build process by unifying compilation commands.

**Example Compilation Command:**

```bash
hipcc -o vector_add vector_add.cpp
```

### **HIPIFY Tools**

- **hipify-perl**: A Perl script that converts CUDA source code to HIP.
- **hipify-clang**: A Clang-based tool for more accurate and automated code conversion.
- **Functionality**:
  - Replaces CUDA-specific keywords, data types, and API calls with their HIP equivalents.
  - Generates code that can be compiled with `hipcc` for both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
# Using hipify-clang
hipify-clang cuda_code.cu -o hip_code.cpp
```

---

## **6. Sample Code**

**CUDA Code Example:**

```cpp
// CUDA kernel
__global__ void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
}
```

**HIP Equivalent:**

```cpp
// HIP kernel
__global__ void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i = hipBlockIdx_x * hipBlockDim_x + hipThreadIdx_x;
    if (i < n) y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
}
```

**Notes:**

- **Indexing Macros**: In HIP, `blockIdx.x`, `blockDim.x`, and `threadIdx.x` can also be used, but `hipBlockIdx_x`, etc., are recommended for clarity.
- **API Calls**: Replace `cudaMalloc` with `hipMalloc`, `cudaMemcpy` with `hipMemcpy`, etc.
- **Error Checking**: Use `hipGetErrorString` instead of `cudaGetErrorString`.

---

## **7. Performance Considerations**

- **Near-Native Performance**: HIP aims to deliver performance close to native CUDA on NVIDIA GPUs and optimized performance on AMD GPUs.
- **Compiler Optimizations**: `hipcc` leverages compiler optimizations specific to the target architecture.
- **Manual Tuning**: For critical code sections, platform-specific optimizations may be necessary.
- **Benchmarking**: Always benchmark on both platforms to ensure performance goals are met.

---

## **8. Limitations and Considerations**

- **Feature Parity**: While HIP covers most of the CUDA API, some advanced features may not be available or require different approaches.
- **Third-Party Libraries**: Libraries like cuDNN or cuBLAS have HIP equivalents (MIOpen, rocBLAS), but code changes may be required.
- **Conditional Compilation**: Use preprocessor directives to handle platform-specific code.

**Example:**

```cpp
#ifdef __HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__
    // AMD-specific code
#elif defined(__HIP_PLATFORM_NVIDIA__)
    // NVIDIA-specific code
#endif
```

- **Unsupported Features**: Certain CUDA features, such as dynamic parallelism or specific intrinsics, may not be supported in HIP.

---

## **9. Ecosystem and Community**

- **ROCm Libraries**: HIP integrates with a range of ROCm libraries for math operations, deep learning, and more.
  - **rocBLAS**: Optimized BLAS library.
  - **MIOpen**: Deep learning library equivalent to cuDNN.
  - **rocFFT**, **rocRAND**, etc.

- **Community Support**:
  - **GitHub Repositories**: Source code, issues, and contributions are managed on GitHub.
  - **Documentation**: Official documentation provides guides, API references, and tutorials.
  - **Forums and Mailing Lists**: Platforms for discussion and support from AMD engineers and the community.

- **Third-Party Frameworks**:
