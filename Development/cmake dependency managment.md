I am having some issues with a [[dependency managment]] when I try to run [[CMake]]. Can you help with with this please.

Certainly, I'd be happy to help with your CMake issue. Could you please provide more details about the problem? Specifically, it would be helpful to know:

1. The exact error message you are receiving.
2. The version of CMake you are using.
3. Your operating system.
4. A brief description of what you are trying to build or the project setup.
5. Any relevant parts of your `CMakeLists.txt` file, if applicable.

This information will help me understand the nature of the problem and provide more accurate assistance.

We are getting an error message on a missing module 'jsoncpp'. I am using a cmake version 3.19.1 that I built from source locally. I was able to get cmake installed on my Linux OS called Ubuntu on ARM architecture, but I get the following error message when I try to use the cmake 3.19.1. "Could NOT find jsoncpp (missing: jsoncpp_DIR)"

The error message "Could NOT find jsoncpp (missing: jsoncpp_DIR)" indicates that [[CMake]] is unable to locate the `jsoncpp` library on your system. `jsoncpp` is a popular [[c++]] library for manipulating JSON data. Here are some steps to resolve this issue:

1. **Install jsoncpp Library:**
   First, ensure that `jsoncpp` is installed on your system. Since you're using Ubuntu, you can install it via the package manager. Open a terminal and run:

   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install libjsoncpp-dev
   ```

   This will install the `jsoncpp` library and its development files.

2. **Setting jsoncpp_DIR:**
   After installing `jsoncpp`, you might need to set the `jsoncpp_DIR` environment variable if CMake still can't find it. This variable should point to the directory containing `jsoncppConfig.cmake` or `jsoncpp-config.cmake`. 

   You can find the path where `jsoncpp` is installed using the `dpkg` command:

   ```
   dpkg -L libjsoncpp-dev
   ```

   Look for a path ending in `/cmake/jsoncpp`. Once you find it, set the `jsoncpp_DIR` environment variable to this path. For example:

   ```bash
   export jsoncpp_DIR=/usr/lib/cmake/jsoncpp
   ```

   Add this line to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` to make the change permanent.

3. **Modify CMakeLists.txt:**
   If the project's `CMakeLists.txt` is not set up to find `jsoncpp` automatically, you might need to modify it. Add these lines to your `CMakeLists.txt`:

   ```cmake
   find_package(jsoncpp REQUIRED)
   include_directories(${JSONCPP_INCLUDE_DIRS})
   ```

   And then link `jsoncpp` to your target:

   ```cmake
   target_link_libraries(your_target_name ${JSONCPP_LIBRARIES})
   ```

   Replace `your_target_name` with the actual target name in your CMake project.

4. **Re-run CMake:**
   After installing `jsoncpp` and making necessary changes, re-run CMake to configure your project. 

Remember that since you're on an ARM architecture, make sure that the `jsoncpp` library you're installing is compatible with ARM. If you've followed these steps and are still encountering issues, there might be a more specific problem with the project configuration or the way `jsoncpp` is being searched for in the `CMakeLists.txt`. In that case, sharing the relevant parts of `CMakeLists.txt` would be helpful for further troubleshooting.

Using the apt install libjsoncpp-dev worked for me. I was able to build, but now I am stuck on compiling. There is an fatal error being thrown on an include statement for filesystem "#include <filesystem>"


The error you're encountering with `#include <filesystem>` suggests that there may be an issue with your compiler or the [[c++]] standard version you're using. The `<filesystem>` library was introduced in [[c++]]17, so you need to ensure a few things:

1. **Compiler Support:**
   Make sure you are using a compiler that supports [[c++]]17 and the `<filesystem>` library. GCC 8 or later, Clang 7 or later, and MSVC 19.14 (Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7) or later have full support for `<filesystem>`. 

2. **Specify [[c++]] Standard:**
   In your `CMakeLists.txt`, you should specify that you want to use the [[c++]]17 standard. You can do this by adding the following lines:

   ```cmake
   set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
   set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
   set(CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS OFF)
   ```

   This tells CMake to use [[c++]]17 and that it is required for the project.

3. **Linking Filesystem Library in GCC and Clang:**
   If you are using GCC (prior to version 9) or Clang, you might need to explicitly link against the filesystem library. Add `-lstdc++fs` (for GCC) or `-lc++fs` (for Clang) to your linker flags. In your `CMakeLists.txt`, it would look something like this:

   ```cmake
   if(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID STREQUAL "GNU" AND CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_VERSION VERSION_LESS 9.1)
       target_link_libraries(your_target_name stdc++fs)
   elseif(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID STREQUAL "Clang")
       target_link_libraries(your_target_name [[c++]]fs)
   endif()
   ```

   Replace `your_target_name` with the name of your target.

4. **Update Your Compiler (if necessary):**
   If your compiler does not support [[c++]]17 or `<filesystem>`, you may need to update it. Since you're using Ubuntu, you can install a newer version of GCC or Clang from the Ubuntu repositories or from a PPA (Personal Package Archive).

5. **Check Your Include Directories:**
   Make sure that your include directories are set correctly in CMake so that the compiler can find all necessary headers.

After making these changes, try re-running CMake and then your build process. If you're still encountering issues, please provide additional details, such as the specific compiler version you're using and any error messages you receive.


How would I set my include directories in cmake?


Setting include directories in CMake is a straightforward process. You typically use the `include_directories()` command for this purpose. This command is used to add directories to the list of directories to be searched for header files during the compilation process. Hereâ€™s how you can use it:

1. **Basic Usage:**
   To add a directory to the include path, use the `include_directories()` command followed by the path to the directory. For example:

   ```[[cmake]]
   include_directories(/path/to/include)
   ```

   This command will add `/path/to/include` to the include path for all targets in your CMake project.

2. **Relative Paths:**
   If the directories are relative to your project root, you can use something like this:

   ```cmake
   include_directories(include)
   ```

   This assumes that there is an `include` directory in the same directory as your top-level `CMakeLists.txt`.

3. **Target-Specific Include Directories:**
   If you want to specify include directories for a specific target (which is often a better practice to avoid polluting global settings), you can use `target_include_directories()`:

   ```cmake
   target_include_directories(your_target_name PRIVATE /path/to/include)
   ```

   In this case, replace `your_target_name` with the name of your target. The `PRIVATE` keyword specifies that the include directories are only for compiling the given target.

4. **Public and Interface Include Directories:**
   If you're creating a library and want to specify include directories that should be used both when building the library and by targets that link against this library, use `PUBLIC` instead of `PRIVATE`:

   ```cmake
   target_include_directories(your_library_name PUBLIC /path/to/include)
   ```

   If the directories should only be added for targets linking against the library (and not for the library itself), use `INTERFACE`:

   ```cmake
   target_include_directories(your_library_name INTERFACE /path/to/include)
   ```

After making these changes in your `CMakeLists.txt` file, re-run CMake to configure your project with the updated settings. This should correctly set up the include directories for your build. Remember to replace `/path/to/include` and `your_target_name` with the actual paths and target names relevant to your project.
